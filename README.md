### Integrated group project as part of Computing degree coursework
Overview 
 Groups will create a web application that demonstrates how to visualise data through appropriate coding practices. The project will involve finding sources of interesting data related to jobs worldwide including two dissimilar sources are required and then selecting and applying suitable visualisations to represent the data. The data should be sourced live via APIs, rather than being previously downloaded. Students should not pick examples that already exist where the data-access and visualisation are already delivered within a sample application. We are looking for students to apply appropriate visualisations to data that they have sourced, to deliver insights from the data.  
 
As well as containing the implementation of the technologies, the web application should also deliver three tutorial pages that explain the techniques utilised within the project. 
 
The application should contain an ‘authors’ page. 
 
The application should be hosted on a suitable platform (such as GitHub Pages or any other familiar web hosting).
